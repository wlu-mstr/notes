Matching: ANTI-join
====================
use certain key fields to determine if two otherwise apparently equal records obviously should not be matched together. Common anti-join fields are:
- standardized generation qualifier (JR, SR, III)
- gender
- government id (ssn) 
- first name (for first initial clusters)
- confirmed exact street name (for address clusters)
- middle initial
- client hard keys
